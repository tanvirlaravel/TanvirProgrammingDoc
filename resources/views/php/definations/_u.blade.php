  <h3>unix time stamp</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Unix time is a count of total seconds since a fixed time and date. It’s a date/time (or timestamp) format that looks different from the human-readable dates and times we’re used to. This is purely for efficiency reasons. It takes a lot less space to store a single number representing seconds than it does to store separate values for the year, month, hour, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
      The unix time stamp is a way to track time as a running total of seconds. This count starts at the Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970 at UTC.
  </p><p>
       Therefore, the unix time stamp is merely the number of seconds between a particular date and the Unix Epoch. 
  </p>
  <p> should also be pointed out (thanks to the comments from visitors to this site) that this point in time technically does not change no matter where you are located on the globe. This is very useful to computer systems for tracking and sorting dated information in dynamic and distributed applications both online and client side.

  <h3>Unix Epoch</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>The Unix epoch is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 at midnight UTC time minus the leap seconds. This means that at midnight of January 1, 1970, Unix time was 0.</p>
  <p>The Unix epoch is also called Unix time, POSIX time, or Unix timestamp</p>
